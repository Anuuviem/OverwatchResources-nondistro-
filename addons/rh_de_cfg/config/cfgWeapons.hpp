Only the Beretta 92F and the SIG P226 satisfactorily completed the trials. According to a GAO report, Beretta was awarded the M9 contract for the 92F due to better durability during endurance testing and a lower total package price. The P226 cost less per pistol than the 92F, but SIG's package price with magazines and spare parts was higher than Beretta's. The Navy SEALs, however, chose to adopt the P226 later after a repetition of failures with some issued Beretta M9s.";

It is much like a Glock 17 with a fire selector switch on its slide that enables it to fire in semi-automatic or fully automatic modes. Rotating the switch toward the bottom of the frame allows for fully automatic fire, while rotating it to the top switches the gun to semi-automatic. The Glock 18 appears identical to the Glock 17, with the addition of the fire selector. However, the internal dimensions of the main parts of the Glock 18 are slightly different from the Glock 17, and are not interchangeable. This was done by Glock so that the Glock 17 could not be considered a semi-automatic version of the Glock 18; rather they are two separate pistols.";
